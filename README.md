AdobeOgg
========

This is a project where I'm building plug-ins for the [Ogg](http://www.xiph.org/ogg/) container format to be used inside the various Adobe applications.

Right now there are working [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/) and [Theora](http://www.theora.org/) plug-ins for Premiere Pro, considered to be a beta release.

The Vorbis plug-in includes support for [FLAC](http://xiph.org/flac/) as well, but only on Mac currently. If anyone wants to try to solve my Windows linking problems, be my guest.
