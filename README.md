AdobeOgg
========

This is a project where I'm building plug-ins for the [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/) audio format to be used inside the various Adobe applications.

Right now there's a working Ogg Vorbis plug-in for Premiere Pro, considered to be a beta release.

The same plug-in includes support for [FLAC](http://xiph.org/flac/) as well, but only on Mac currently. If anyone wants to try to solve my Windows linking problems, be my guest.
